            27. The Promoter and its associated agencies and companies will not
            be liable for any delay, damage, or loss in transit of prizes.

            28. The Promoter may in its absolute discretion not accept a
            particular entry, may disqualify an entry, or cancel the entire
            Promotion at any time without giving reasons and without liability
            to any entrants. Without limiting this the Promoter reserves the
            right to verify the validity of entries, prize claims and entrants
            and to disqualify any entrant who submits an entry or prize claim
            that is misleading or not in accordance with these Terms of entry or
            who manipulates or tampers with the entry process. In the event that
            a winner breaches these Terms of entry, the winner will forfeit the
            prize in whole and no substitute will be offered. Verification is at
            the discretion of the Promoter, whose decision is final. Failure by
            the Promoter to enforce any of its rights at any stage does not
            constitute a waiver of those rights.

            29. Prizes, or any unused portion of a prize, are not transferable
            or exchangeable and cannot be taken as cash, subject to any written
            directions from a regulatory authority. Where a prize is unavailable
            for any reason, the Promoter may substitute the prize for another
            item of equal or higher value. The Promoter accepts no
            responsibility for any variation in prize value (including between
            advertising of the Promotion and receipt of the prize).

            30. In the case of the intervention of any outside act, agent or
            event which prevents or significantly hinders the Promoterâ€™s ability
            (or that of a third party involved with the Promotion) to proceed
            with the Promotion on the dates and in the manner described in these
            Terms of entry, including but not limited to vandalism, natural
            disasters, acts of God, civil unrest, strike, war, act of terrorism,
            the Promoterâ€™s obligations in respect of the Promotion will be
            suspended for the duration of the event and, in addition, the
            Promoter may in its absolute discretion cancel the promotion and
            recommence it from the start on the same conditions, subject to
            approval of the relevant authorities

            of entering into this Promotion, entrants agree to assign all their
            rights in and to their entry and any related content to the
            Promoter, including any copyright or other intellectual property
            rights in the entry and related content. Without limiting this, the
            Promoter may use entry content for any and all purposes including
            commercial purposes. You warrant that entry content is original,
            lawful and not misleading and that the Promoterâ€™s use of such

            private information for promotional, marketing, publicity, research
